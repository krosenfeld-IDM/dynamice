**DynaMICE (Dynamic Measles Immunisation Calculation Engine)** is an age-structured compartmental model for measles transmission and vaccination. 


Details of model structure and assumptions can be found in the following references:

The model has also been applied in the following studies to understand measles vaccination impact in different settings:
